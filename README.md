# MLISP-Lab
Machine Learning in Signal Processing Lab Course

- Goal: Build a simulator that creates synthetical lane images. Build a network that classifies the pixels of a given real image as lane or not lane.
- I didn't upload the full code that is called in the jupyter notebooks since I only partially coded these parts. The skeleton was provided by the LMS chair at FAU Erlangen.
